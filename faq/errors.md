## Not replying to <mark style="color:blue;">/create</mark>

If the bot does not reply to `/create` then that could mean:

* You entered an incorrect time. Here's an example of a correct one: `5d 4h 3m 2s`
* Your `description` or `title` is too long!
* The channel is not a channel or the bot does not have permissions to send messages in there!
* Another error occurred! Go to our support server in [links](../links.md)&#x20;
